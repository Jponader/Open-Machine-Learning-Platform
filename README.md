# Open-Machine-Learning-Platform
A Flask based webiste, for building nueral networks.

## Application
The application is divided into 3 compoents, a webserver, backend buidler worker, and backend predictor worker. All componets have been designed to run on AWS using a RDS MYSQL database, S3 File Storage, and 2 SQS queues for communication between the webserver and the backend workers. This project can be run locally using the MasterRunner script, which simulates BOTO3 (AWS SDK) and starts all servers. 

### Webserver
Presents a frontend interface to the user. Can be used to build a model and pick a model for prediction.

### Builder
Takes data and builds a model based on said data. This model is autogenerated and trained.

### Predictor
Takes data and selected model, make predictions and return the prediction output.

## Future Work
### UBYTE
Allow for the use of ubyte code as a type of data input.
### Zipped Image Files
Allow for the use of a set of zipped images as data input, also add convolutional layers to the model construction.
### Downloadable Execution
Allow for the model to be downloaded and run inside of its own executable.
